Setting up a repository for this project

#Steps to set up my DB
- Open workbench on your local computer then proceed to file -> Open Model
- Open my file named LittleLemonDBModel
- This is the ER diagram that you can use to forward engineer and build my database.
- select file -> open script -> choose the CreateTables_PopulateTables script and run it in the created schema to fill the database with sample data.
- You will also notice there are scripts for the different procedures and views that we were asked to create in this project. You can also load them up into the schema and execute them to add them to the littlelemonDB schema.
